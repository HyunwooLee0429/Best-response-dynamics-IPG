## **Best-Response Dynamics Incorporated Zero-Regret Algorithm for Large-scale Integer Programming Games**

This repository contains the implementation of algorithms for finding the best Pure Nash Equilibria (PNE) in large-scale Integer Programming Games (IPGs), focusing on two important game classes:
1. Edge-weighted Budgeted Maximum Coverage (EBMC) Games
2. Knapsack Problem Games (KPGs)

The core algorithm is a **Best-Response Dynamics Incorporated Zero-Regret (BZR)** algorithm, which integrates the state-of-the-art zero-regret algorithm with a clockwork-random best-response dynamics component (CR-BRD).

üìÅ Folder Structure
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This repository consists of two main folders:

## **1. BZR_EBMC (for EBMC Games)**

üìò Jupyter Notebooks:

- **BZR_EBMC.ipynb**:
  Contains full implementation of CR-BRD, ZR, and BZR algorithms. Allows switching between synthetic datasets (single/multiple AIS) and the real Minnesota dataset.

- **EBMC_generator.ipynb**:
  Generates random EBMC game instances for both single-AIS and multi-AIS settings.

- **County-level.ipynb**:
  Compares strategy profiles (e.g., NG, PNE, OSW) at the county level using the Minnesota dataset.
  Some profiles are precomputed via `BZR_EBMC.ipynb`.

üìÇ Subfolders:

- **EBMC_generated/**:
  Contains synthetic EBMC game instances generated by `EBMC_generator.ipynb`.

- **EBMC_minnesota/**:
  Contains real-world Minnesota boat movement data and county-level budget information.

- **EBMC_results/**:
  Includes all result outputs for both synthetic and Minnesota datasets.

## **2. BZR_KPG (for Knapsack Problem Games)**

üìò Jupyter Notebooks:

- **BZR_KPG.ipynb**:
  Core implementation of CR-BRD, ZR, and BZR algorithms adapted to the KPG framework. Supports three types of interaction models: 'A', 'B', and 'C'.

- **KPG_generator.ipynb**:
  Generates synthetic KPG instances. This Python version is adapted from the original C++ generator by Dragotto and Scatamacchia (2023):
  https://github.com/gdragotto/ZeroRegretsAlgorithm/blob/main/instance_generators/instances_kp/generator.cpp

  üí° *Remark*: For interaction type 'C', interaction coefficients were modified from uniform [-R, R] to [-1/5¬∑R, 0] to improve feasibility in large-scale experiments.

üìÇ Subfolders:

- **KPG_generated/**:
  Contains synthetic KPG instances for all three interaction types.

- **KPG_results/**:
  Includes results for all tested KPG instances.
